## Hi there, I'm [Xuyang Liu](https://xuyang-liu16.github.io/)! :sunglasses:

I am currently a first-year Master's student at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Honggang Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/honggangchen/). Previously, I had the honor of visiting the [Visual Intelligence & Perception Lab (VIP Lab)](https://zhengfenglab.com/) at [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), led by [Prof. Feng Zheng](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=fengzheng&go=1&iscss=1&snapid=1&lang=en), and also gained valuable experience at the [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/), guided by [Siteng Huang](https://kyonhuang.top/).

:pushpin: My research interests focus on **Efficient Multi-modal Large Language Models**, including:

* **Discrimination**: [visual grounding](https://github.com/TheShadow29/awesome-grounding) and [referring video object segmentation](https://github.com/gaomingqi/Awesome-Video-Object-Segmentation).
* **Adaptation**: [parameter-efficient transfer learning](https://github.com/synbol/Awesome-Parameter-Efficient-Transfer-Learning) and [model acceleration](https://github.imc.re/VainF/Torch-Pruning).  
* **Reconstruction**: [super-resolution](https://github.com/ChaofWang/Awesome-Super-Resolution) and [image quality assessment](https://github.com/chaofengc/Awesome-Image-Quality-Assessment).
* **Generation**: [text-to-image generation](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo/awesome-text-to-image-studies) and [text-to-video generation](https://github.com/soraw-ai/Awesome-Text-to-Video-Generation).
