## Hi there, I'm [Xuyang Liu](https://xuyang-liu16.github.io/)! :sunglasses:

I am Xuyang Liu (刘旭洋 in Chinese), a first-year Master's student at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Honggang Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/honggangchen/). Currently, I am working as a research intern at [Taobao & Tmall Group](https://talent.taotian.com/), focusing on [Efficient MLLM](https://github.com/lijiannuist/Efficient-Multimodal-LLMs-Survey). Previously, I had the honor of visiting the [Visual Intelligence & Perception Lab (VIP Lab)](https://zhengfenglab.com/) at [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), supervised by Prof. [Feng Zheng](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=fengzheng&go=1&iscss=1&snapid=1&lang=en). I also gained valuable experience at the [Machine Intelligence Lab (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/donglin-wang.html). I am also very glad to be supervised and collaborated with Dr. [Siteng Huang](https://kyonhuang.top/) from DAMO Academy and Asst. Prof. [Linfeng Zhang](http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/) from SJTU.

:pushpin: My research interests focus on **Efficient Multi-modal Large Language Models**, including:

* **Discrimination**: [visual grounding](https://github.com/TheShadow29/awesome-grounding) and [referring video object segmentation](https://github.com/gaomingqi/Awesome-Video-Object-Segmentation).
* **Adaptation**: [parameter-efficient transfer learning](https://github.com/synbol/Awesome-Parameter-Efficient-Transfer-Learning) and [model acceleration](https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/Efficient-Deep-Learning).  
* **Reconstruction**: [super-resolution](https://github.com/ChaofWang/Awesome-Super-Resolution) and [image quality assessment](https://github.com/chaofengc/Awesome-Image-Quality-Assessment).
* **Generation**: [text-to-image generation](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo/awesome-text-to-image-studies) and [text-to-video generation](https://github.com/soraw-ai/Awesome-Text-to-Video-Generation).
