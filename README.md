### Hi there, I'm Xuyang Liu! :sunglasses:

I am a first-year Master student at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Honggang Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/honggangchen/). Additionally, I am a visiting student at the [Visual Intelligence & Perception Laboratory (VIP Lab)](https://zhengfenglab.com/) at [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), led by [Prof. Feng Zhen](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=fengzheng&go=1&iscss=1&snapid=1&lang=en). Previously, I had the honor of visiting the [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) where I worked under the guidance of [Siteng Huang](https://kyonhuang.top/).

:pushpin: My current research focus on:
* **Vision-language Learning**: visual grounding (VG) and referring video object segmentation (RVOS).
* **Transfer Learning**: zero-shot learning (ZSL) and parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL).
* **Generative Models**: text-to-image generaction (Text2Image) and text-to-video generaction (Text2Video).

:raised_hands: Feel free to contact me at [this email](liuxuyang@stu.scu.edu.cn), if you are interested in collaboration opportunities. 

:see_no_evil: Please note, the profile picture depicts my lovely girlfriend **Xinying Lin**, with whom I affectionately share the squared term (lxy<sup>2</sup>) from our identical English initials.
